What is JWT?
JWT stands for JSON Web Token, a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

What is JWT used for?
JWT is primarily used for securely transmitting information between a client and a server, often for authentication and authorization.

How does JWT work?
JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header specifies the token type and algorithm, the payload contains the claims or data, and the signature is used to verify the token's integrity.

Header: 
Consists of two parts:
- The signing algorithm that’s being used.
- The type of token, which, in this case, is mostly “JWT”.

Payload: The payload contains the claims or the JSON object.

Signature: A string that is generated via a cryptographic algorithm that can be used to verify the integrity of the JSON payload.


Is JWT secure?
JWT is secure because it is signed using a secret key or a public/private key pair, ensuring that the token is not tampered with during transmission.

What are the advantages of using JWT?
JWT is stateless, meaning no server-side storage is needed. 
It's also compact and can be easily passed in URLs, headers, or cookies.

Can JWT be used for sessions?
Yes, JWT is commonly used to manage user sessions, replacing traditional session mechanisms with token-based authentication.

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure, compact way to transmit information between a client and server, often used for authentication. It consists of three parts: a header, payload, and signature. JWTs are stateless, making them scalable and efficient for session management.



JWT، أو رمز الويب المعتمد على JSON،
 هو وسيلة آمنة ومضغوطة لنقل المعلومات بين طرفين، مثل العميل والخادم.
 وغالبًا ما يُستخدم للتحقق من الهوية والتفويض.
 يتكون من ثلاثة أجزاء: الرأس، الذي يحدد نوع الرمز وخوارزمية التشفير؛ الحمولة، التي تحتوي على البيانات المنقولة؛ والتوقيع، الذي يضمن سلامة الرمز وصحته.
